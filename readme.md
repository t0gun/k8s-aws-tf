# Kubernetes the Hard Way on AWS with Terraform & SSM

You have heard of the popular [Kubernetes The Hard
Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). This project version is rebuilt on AWS using modern
infrastructure patterns.it automates the entire compute layer, eliminating jumpbox, SSH and makes every machine
reachable through SSM.Amazon linux was also adapted for this project due to its preinstalled SSM agent eliminating the
need for user data.If you want to understand Kubernetes properly, but you also want a clean, automated setup that
doesn’t break core AWS security principles, you can fork this repo and read my guide.
